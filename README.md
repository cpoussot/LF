# Loewner Framework (LF)

### Overview

The Loewner Framework (LF) is a data-driven model identification and reduction technique that takes its root in ["bla"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00495), by B.A Anderson and A.C. Antoulas, where connection between the Loewner matrix and rational barycentric form was highlighted. Later in ["bla"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00495), by A.J. Mayo and A.C. Antoulas extented this framework to connect the Loewner (and shifted Loewner) matrix to minimal realization, bridginig the gap between rational interpolation and system theory. 

Using only measured data, the LF constructs surrogate models directly and with low computational effort (only linear algebra operations are needed). For recent tutorial papers on LF applied to linear dynamical systems, we refer the reader to ["bla"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00495), A.C. Antoulas, A.C. Ionita and S. Lefteriu.

It is suited to approximate, from any data-set 
- an interpolatory model given with a realization,
- with minimal complexity.
